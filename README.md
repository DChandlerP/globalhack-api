# Ambassador Connect

Immigrating to  the United States can be exciting and scary.  It can be difficult to navigate the resources and systems of new place.  If only you had an Ambassador or local guide to help you through the process.  Maybe someone who has been through the exact process.  

## Ambassadors

You've gone through the grueling process of settling into the United States and you remember how overwhelming the whole process is.  Use your experiences to help another individual or family who has just begun that process by signing up to be an Ambassador. Set up your profile with any and all resources you feel like you can assist with.  Give permission to undergo a background check and complete a video tutorial and quiz on appropriate boundaries in working with those who are new to the United States. You'll soon be contacted when needs match your skills.

##  Agencies

For the first time ever, you have access to a well of shared volunteers.  Volunteers who are familiar with obtaining food stamps for a family that speaks Spanish.  Volunteers who are familiar with the process of obtaining a VISA.  Volunteers who speak Bosnian and know which preschool has a Bosnian teacher and know how to enroll your children in that school.  Volunteers who have completed an extensive Background Search and are rated by other agencies.  

Whether you're meeting with a client and they need help opening a checking account or they need someone to help them navigate a medical appointment, search Ambassador Connect for an individual who can help.


## Immigrants / Refugees

You're in an entirely new place and want to get settled but don't know where to begin.  Set up a meeting with a local organization serving Immigrants and Refugees. During your appointment, they will match you with a local, trusted Ambassador that can help navigate you through your transition.  These Ambassadors are individuals who are eager to help you become familiar with finding local resources, navigate the systems, and who are ready to show you the answers when you have questions.
